== N-Queens Solver

This program provides an experimentation platform to test different
solutions to solving the N-Queens problem (with the specific constraints
described below).

=== Problem Statement

Place N queens on an NxN chess board so that none of them attack each
other (the classic n-queens problem). Additionally, please make sure that
no three queens are in a straight line at ANY angle, so queens on A1, C2
and E3, despite not attacking each other, form a straight line at some
angle.
